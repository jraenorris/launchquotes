# launchquotes
An app for Launchers to share memorable quotes and motivation throughout the cohort

# Status
This app was developed in Sinatra while attending Launch Academy. While the basic functionality works, there are still holes in the sanitation of entered data. While the database is safe, the styling is still at risk from malicious users. 

It's possible I will come back to this project and fix it up a bit, however, I do not anticipate this being the case. I have graduated the Launch Academy program and have moved on to other projects.

# Contributors
I'm open to contributors and would welcome any future Launcher to pick up where I left off. Friday Funtime is a great addition to the Launch community and having a second Funtime activity (or maybe just an ongoing site to keep you going until the next Friday?) could be, well, fun :)
